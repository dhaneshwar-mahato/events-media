# events-media

Event Media is a platform that connects service providers (photographers, videographers, tent owners, caterers, mehndi designers, band groups, drone riders) with clients looking for event-related services. It allows providers to list their services and equipment for rent, and clients can search, compare, and book services based on location and requirements.
